# Documentation Index

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Vue Environment Comparison Tool.

## Documentation Files

### [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
High-level system architecture, component relationships, and technical overview. Read this first to understand how the entire solution works together.

### [COMPONENT_GUIDE.md](./COMPONENT_GUIDE.md)
Detailed guide to all Vue components, their purposes, props, methods, and interactions. Essential for understanding the frontend structure.

### [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)
Complete development workflow, coding standards, testing procedures, and deployment processes. Your go-to guide for development tasks.

## Quick Reference

### Key Components
- **EnvironmentComparison.vue**: Main comparison interface
- **EntityManager.vue**: Generic CRUD interface for entities
- **comparisonClient.js**: Cross-environment API handling
- **unifiedGraphQLClient.js**: Centralized GraphQL client

### Key Concepts
- **Environment Comparison**: Side-by-side data comparison between environments
- **Entity Configuration**: Flexible configuration system for different data types
- **Difference Analysis**: Automated detection and highlighting of data differences
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass data operations with progress tracking

### Development Workflow
1. Read architecture documentation
2. Set up development environment
3. Follow coding standards
4. Write tests
5. Update documentation

## Keeping Documentation Updated

### When to Update
- Adding new components or features
- Changing existing component interfaces
- Modifying architecture or data flow
- Adding new development processes
- Fixing bugs that affect documented behavior

### How to Update
1. **Architecture changes**: Update ARCHITECTURE.md
2. **Component changes**: Update COMPONENT_GUIDE.md
3. **Process changes**: Update DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md
4. **New features**: Update all relevant docs

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep diagrams and flowcharts updated
- Version control documentation changes
- Review documentation in pull requests

## Auto-Update Strategy

To keep documentation synchronized with code changes:

### 1. Git Hooks
Consider implementing pre-commit hooks that remind developers to update documentation when certain files change.

### 2. Pull Request Templates
Include documentation checklist in PR templates:
- [ ] Updated component documentation if interfaces changed
- [ ] Updated architecture docs if system design changed
- [ ] Updated development guide if processes changed

### 3. Regular Reviews
Schedule periodic documentation reviews to ensure accuracy and completeness.

### 4. Documentation Tests
Consider implementing tests that validate documentation examples still work with current code.

## AI Assistant Integration

This documentation is designed to work with AI assistants like Amazon Q:

### Benefits
- **Context Preservation**: AI can reference these docs instead of re-analyzing code
- **Consistency**: Standardized information reduces confusion
- **Efficiency**: Faster responses to development questions
- **Knowledge Transfer**: New team members can get up to speed quickly

### Best Practices
- Keep documentation current and accurate
- Use consistent terminology across all docs
- Include practical examples and use cases
- Structure information hierarchically
