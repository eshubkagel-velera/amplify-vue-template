# Security Implementation

## Authentication Changes
- **Primary Auth**: Cognito User Pools (secure user authentication)
- **Fallback**: API Key (30-day expiration for development)
- **User Context**: All mutations now use authenticated user ID

## Authorization Controls
- All mutations require authenticated user (`$ctx.identity.sub`)
- Input validation for URL_TYPE_CODE (must be 'E' or 'N')
- URL field validation (required, non-empty)
- Automatic user ID injection for audit trails

## IAM Security
- Restricted KMS permissions to specific key ARNs
- Limited CloudWatch logs access to AppSync log groups
- Removed wildcard permissions

## Deployment Security
To deploy with new security:

1. **Deploy backend**: `cd backend && npx serverless deploy`
2. **Update frontend**: Configure Amplify with Cognito User Pool
3. **Create users**: Use AWS Console or Cognito APIs

## User Management
- Users must be created in Cognito User Pool
- Email verification required
- Strong password policy enforced
- JWT tokens for API access

## Audit Trail
- All operations logged with user ID
- CloudWatch logs for monitoring
- User email captured in context

## Next Steps for Production
1. Separate environments (different AWS accounts)
2. Row-level security based on user ownership
3. Rate limiting and DDoS protection
4. WAF rules for additional protection
